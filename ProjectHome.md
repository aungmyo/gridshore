This is the google home page for most of my projects. There are a lot of sample applications to be found here. Most of them are discussed in my blog items which you can find on my blog http://www.gridshore.nl.

If you have issues or requests please use the Issues tab from this project.

The following table gives you an overview of the different samples and there main technologies and reasons I created them.

|gea-news-feed|Google app engine, Spring framework|Sampe application used to demonstrate the capabilities of google app engine | none sofar, the presentation can be downloaded|
|Hippo spring connector|Hippo, spring-ws, springframework|This application is used to show how you can connect to hippo from a spring framework application. A webservice is created that can search the hippo repository using the spring-ws project|[roadtrip-from-springframework-to-hippo-7](http://www.gridshore.nl/2008/12/04/roadtrip-from-springframework-to-hippo-7/), [connecting-to-hippo-ecm-using-a-springframework-connector](http://www.gridshore.nl/2009/01/16/connecting-to-hippo-ecm-using-a-springframework-connector/)|

|Raffle     |Google web toolkit|This application I used to explain he basics of Google web toolkit| [Rowing-the-Google-Web-Toolkit-boat-with-intellij](http://www.gridshore.nl/blog/index.php?/archives/69-Rowing-the-Google-Web-Toolkit-boat-with-intellij.html)|
|Raffle App |jpa, annotations, google web toolkit, wicket, jquery|I used this application to show multiple front end frameworks. Before you can start with the front end, you need to have a solid back end. Therefore I tried jpa using springframework and hibernate at the back end. The different front ends all use the same back end without changes.|[Creating-an-application-with-maven2,-jpa,-springframework-and-intellij](http://www.gridshore.nl/blog/index.php?/archives/72-Creating-an-application-with-maven2,-jpa,-springframework-and-intellij.html), [start-using-jquery-with-some-small-samples-and-using-spring-mvc-25](http://www.gridshore.nl/2008/01/24/start-using-jquery-with-some-small-samples-and-using-spring-mvc-25/)|
|Spring OSGi Sample|OSGi, springframework|My first thing I did with OSGi, I must admit that I did not understand that much about OSGi back than.|[Spring-osgi-an-evaluation-using-maven-2-and-the-special-spring-osgi-archetype](http://www.gridshore.nl/blog/index.php?/archives/59-Spring-osgi-an-evaluation-using-maven-2-and-the-special-spring-osgi-archetype.html)|
|Springframework archetype|springframework, maven2, acegi|I was doing a lot of projects with the same kind of architecture. I also wanted to experiment with maven archetype. So the ideal combination to create my custom archetype.|[Creating-a-maven-archetype-for-acegi-and-springframework](http://www.gridshore.nl/blog/index.php?/archives/55-Creating-a-maven-archetype-for-acegi-and-springframework.html)|
|Training Overview|spring 2.5, annotations, jpa, jquery, maven|In this application we go to the extreme with plain web development. A lot about using spring mvc 2.5 in combination with jquery.

|Ajax dwr sample |dwr, springframework, scriptoculous|One of the most known implementations is creating auto complete solutions. With this project I create an autocomplete using scriptoculous and dwr. The blog item in which I described the solutions is still one of the best read posts of my blog.|[Creating-an-autocomplete-with-Spring-and-DWR](http://www.gridshore.nl/blog/index.php?/archives/52-Creating-an-autocomplete-with-Spring-and-DWR.html)|
|books-overview|flex 3, BlazeDS, springframework|This is the latest sample I have created. This is also the sample for the coming months. I a experimenting a lot with flex 3 and I show all this is this sample. For now there is a custom component for filtering results in a DataGrid. Beware, there are some tags for this project. The trunk is not always the best thing to use.|[creating-a-flex-3-datagrid-component-with-backend-filtering](http://www.gridshore.nl/2008/03/25/creating-a-flex-3-datagrid-component-with-backend-filtering/), [integrating-flex-3-with-spring-security-formerly-known-as-acegi](http://www.gridshore.nl/2008/05/11/integrating-flex-3-with-spring-security-formerly-known-as-acegi/) [integration-spring-security-acegi-and-flex-3-the-sequel](http://www.gridshore.nl/2008/07/14/integration-spring-security-acegi-and-flex-3-the-sequel/) [wow-springframework-enters-the-actionscript-and-flex-domain/](http://www.gridshore.nl/2009/01/05/wow-springframework-enters-the-actionscript-and-flex-domain/) |
